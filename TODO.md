# TODO

## Features

- Checkbox/slider to keep map scale constant (keep color scale constant?)
- Add loading overlay when options changed (faded out and spinner)
- Map to check/uncheck states in time graph
- Some way to make the data auto-refresh?
- Add a smoothing option (average change/doubling rate over multiple days)
- Add link to readme explaining options
- Add daily change in absolute number of cases (instead of percentage)

## Fix

- Hover labels on map which I can't change *for some stupid reason* (aaaaaargh)
- Make the map have a default state, instead of the empty graph look (might be fixed by adding loading overlay)
